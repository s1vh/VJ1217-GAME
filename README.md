# VJ1217-GAME
VJ1217 project

This is a game made by a two persons team (Karrion and me) for our grade's Web Game Design subject. You are the Nyan Cat, and your objetctive is to take as many stars as possible while avoiding enemies. Enemies will spawn procedurally, depending on your current velocity and star recount. When you get hit your velocity resets to its initial value, otherwise it will increase logarithmically. When you are at the limit, you will enter in Turbo Mode, on which more stars will be spawn, they will gravity to you and you get less damage from your next hit.

It is written in ac3 and we used the Starling (and API focused on development for mobile devices) and TweenLite libraries.
